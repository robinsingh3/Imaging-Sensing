# Imaging-Sensing




**Question 1:**

Explain the fundamental differences between CCD (Charge-Coupled Device) and CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) image sensors. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each in the context of mobile imaging applications.

**Answer:**

CCD Sensors:

Operation: CCD sensors move charge across the chip and read it at one corner of the array.
Advantages:
High image quality with low noise.
Excellent uniformity and sensitivity.
Disadvantages:
Higher power consumption.
Slower readout speeds.
More expensive to manufacture.
CMOS Sensors:

Operation: CMOS sensors use transistors at each pixel to amplify and move the charge using traditional wiring.
Advantages:
Lower power consumption.
Faster readout speeds.
Integration of additional circuitry on the chip (e.g., ADCs).
Less expensive to produce.
Disadvantages:
Historically, higher noise levels (though modern CMOS sensors have mitigated this).
Context in Mobile Imaging:

CCD Limitations: Due to higher power consumption and cost, CCDs are less suitable for mobile devices, which prioritize battery life and cost-effectiveness.
CMOS Benefits: CMOS sensors are preferred in mobile applications because they offer faster readout speeds, lower power usage, and the ability to integrate additional functionalities, all of which are critical for mobile devices.
