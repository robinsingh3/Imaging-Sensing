Advantages:
Lower power consumption.
Faster readout speeds.
Integration of additional circuitry on the chip (e.g., ADCs).
Less expensive to produce.
Disadvantages:
Historically, higher noise levels (though modern CMOS sensors have mitigated this).

**Answer:**

Camera Calibration Process:

Capture Calibration Images:
Take multiple images of a known pattern (e.g., a checkerboard) from different angles and positions.
Detect Feature Points:
Identify the corners or markers in the images using image processing algorithms.
Estimate Camera Parameters:
Compute intrinsic parameters (focal length, optical center, distortion coefficients).
Compute extrinsic parameters (rotation and translation relative to the world coordinate system).
Optimize Parameters:
Use algorithms like least squares to minimize re-projection error.
Importance in Computer Vision:

Accuracy: Calibration ensures that measurements and reconstructions are accurate.
Distortion Correction: Corrects lens distortions, which is essential for tasks like 3D reconstruction, AR, and object recognition.
Example for Mobile Device Calibration:

Setup: Use a mobile device to capture images of a checkerboard pattern.
Data Collection: Collect images ensuring the checkerboard fills different parts of the frame and is captured at various orientations.
Processing: Use a calibration toolkit (e.g., OpenCV) to detect corners and compute calibration parameters.
Validation: Apply the calibration to correct distortion in test images and verify the accuracy.

CMOS Benefits: CMOS sensors are preferred in mobile applications because they offer faster readout speeds, lower power usage, and the ability to integrate additional functionalities, all of which are critical for mobile devices.
